# hammer.io

## Welcome to Hammer-IO's bug and feature tracking repository!

The goal of this repository is to track requested features and bug reports
from our end users. The Hammer team will then review the issue and respond
to the person who opened the issue. Our team will link these issues to existing
issues within the corresponding subsystem.

## Contributing

Visit the [Issues tab](https://github.com/hammer-io/hammer/issues) and search
to see if the bug/feature being reported/requested is already in an open issue.
If you find one, feel free to add any supplementary information to the issue
that the team may find useful. Otherwise, create a new issue and provide as
much detail as possible (explanation, screenshots, steps to reproduce, etc)
to help our team address your concerns.

Thank you for helping us build a better experience!
